# AI Slop as Pop

AI created content is already falling out of taste, with term "slop" for AI content now being widely used. It may become like pop music that some people still like but ultimately do not value much compared to other types of music, for its lack of soul. 


The pop music industry is a:

- machine

- which takes authentic human meaning

- and produces essentially a stochastic echo of it ("slop")

- in an optimisation algorithm

- to predict the next most profitable song (the song that is most "likely")


However, people are shaped by pop music today (as well as pop movies and pop tv), an AI may have a similar size of influence; large but not all encompassing - there is still demand for more authentic music.
