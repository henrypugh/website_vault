# Metaphors

Metaphors are how we initially understand a new idea. They act as a bridge between old ideas and new ideas and bring the two closer together.


# Examples

- [[Memes as Extended Phenotype]] - Ideology as life promoting for the individual (not independent of the individual)
- [[Memes as Mind Virus]] - Ideology is independent of the individual. 
- [[AI slop as pop]] - AI to be seen as equivalent to pop from the music industry.
