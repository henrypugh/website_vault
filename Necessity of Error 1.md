# Necessity of Error

*The road to wisdom? —Well, it’s plain* 

*and simple to express:*  

*Err*  

*and err*  

*and err again*  

*but less*  

*and less*  

*and less.*

-- Piet Hien


*We do not consider the falsity of a judgment as itself an objection to a judgment; this is perhaps where our new language will sound most foreign. The question is how far the judgment promotes and preserves life, how well it preserves, and perhaps even cultivates, the type. And we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments [...] are the most indispensable to us, and that without accepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the wholly invented world of the unconditioned and self-identical, without a constant falsification of the world through numbers, people could not live – that a renunciation of false judgments would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. To acknowledge untruth as a condition of life: this clearly means resisting the usual value feelings in a dangerous manner; and a philosophy that risks such a thing would by that gesture alone place itself beyond good and evil. 
-- Nietzsche


Nietzsche's quote saying falseness of a judgement is not an objection to it. It is impossible to not make false judgement due to, limited information, being forced to make judgements, the nature of the world. Darwinian evolution requiring random variation and failures, for one variation to succeed. We all see extinction as tragedy. Something lost forever. Companies must trial and error [[Universal Darwinism]]. Trial and error is the scientific method. So we have converge on an idea from multiple sources, for objection to the falseness of an idea being no objection to it.

Religion as a false judgment or error but useful anyway to those that believe in it. [[Memes as Extended Phentotype]]
