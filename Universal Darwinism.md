# Universal Darwinism

Edit test number 2

## Basic mechanisms

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Darwinism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Basic mechanisms")]

At the most fundamental level, [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin")'s theory of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") states that organisms evolve and [adapt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation") to their environment by an iterative process. This process can be conceived as an [evolutionary algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm "Evolutionary algorithm") that searches the space of possible forms (the [fitness landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape "Fitness landscape")) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:

- [variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity "Genetic diversity") of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by [mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation "Mutation") or [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination "Genetic recombination").
- [selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(biology) "Selection (biology)") of the [fittest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology) "Fitness (biology)") variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated.
- [heredity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity "Heredity") or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring.

After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration"). The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of [trial-and-error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial-and-error "Trial-and-error") or generate-and-test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes.

The generalization made in "universal" Darwinism is to replace "organism" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can "survive" (maintain, be retained) long enough or "reproduce" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there is a selective "preference" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce "better" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms.

Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes "Genes"), ideas ([memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memes "Memes")), theories, technologies, [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons "Neurons") and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, [antibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibodies "Antibodies"), institutions, law and judicial systems, quantum states and even whole universes.[5](app://obsidian.md/5)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-5))

## History and development

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Darwinism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History and development")]

Conceptually, "evolutionary theorizing about cultural, social, and economic phenomena" preceded Darwin,[6](app://obsidian.md/6)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-6)) but was still lacking the concept of natural selection. Darwin himself, together with subsequent 19th-century thinkers such as [Herbert Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer "Herbert Spencer"), [Thorstein Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen "Thorstein Veblen"), [James Mark Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mark_Baldwin "James Mark Baldwin") and [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James "William James"), was quick to apply the idea of selection to other domains, such as language, psychology, society, and culture.[7](app://obsidian.md/7)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-7)) However, this evolutionary tradition was largely banned from the social sciences in the beginning of the 20th century, in part because of the bad reputation of [social Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism "Social Darwinism"), an attempt to use Darwinism to justify social inequality.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Starting in the 1950s, [Donald T. Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_T._Campbell) was one of the first and most influential authors to revive the tradition, and to formulate a generalized Darwinian [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") directly applicable to phenomena outside of biology.[8](app://obsidian.md/8)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-8)) In this, he was inspired by [William Ross Ashby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ross_Ashby "William Ross Ashby")'s view of [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization") and intelligence as fundamental processes of selection.[9](app://obsidian.md/9)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-9)) His aim was to explain the development of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and other forms of [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") by focusing on the variation and selection of ideas and theories, thus laying the basis for the domain of [evolutionary epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_epistemology "Evolutionary epistemology"). In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of "blind-variation-and-selective-retention" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of "universal selection theory"[10](app://obsidian.md/10)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-10)) or "universal selectionism"[11](app://obsidian.md/11)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-11)) by his disciples [Gary Cziko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cziko "Gary Cziko"),[12](app://obsidian.md/12)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-auto-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-12)%5B%5B13%5D%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-auto-13)) Mark Bickhard,[14](app://obsidian.md/14)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-14)) and [Francis Heylighen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Heylighen "Francis Heylighen").[15](app://obsidian.md/15)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-15)%5B%5B16%5D%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-16))

[Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins") may have first coined the term "universal Darwinism" in 1983 to describe his conjecture that any possible life forms existing outside the solar system would evolve by natural selection just as they do on Earth.[17](app://obsidian.md/17)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-17)) This conjecture was also presented in 1983 in a paper entitled “The Darwinian Dynamic” that dealt with the evolution of order in living systems and certain nonliving physical systems.[18](app://obsidian.md/18)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-18)) It was suggested “that ‘life’, wherever it might exist in the universe, evolves according to the same dynamical law” termed the Darwinian dynamic. [Henry Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Plotkin "Henry Plotkin") in his 1997 book[19](app://obsidian.md/19)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-19)) on [Darwin machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_machine "Darwin machine") makes the link between universal Darwinism and Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. [Susan Blackmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Blackmore "Susan Blackmore"), in her 1999 book _[The Meme Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meme_Machine "The Meme Machine")_, devotes a chapter titled 'Universal Darwinism' to a discussion of the applicability of the Darwinian process to a wide range of scientific subject matters.

The philosopher of mind [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett "Daniel Dennett"), in his 1995 book _[Darwin's Dangerous Idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_Dangerous_Idea "Darwin's Dangerous Idea")_, developed the idea of a Darwinian process, involving variation, selection and retention, as a generic algorithm that is substrate-neutral and could be applied to many fields of knowledge outside of biology. He described the idea of natural selection as a "universal acid" that cannot be contained in any vessel, as it seeps through the walls and spreads ever further, touching and transforming ever more domains. He notes in particular the field of [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics "Memetics") in the social sciences.[20](app://obsidian.md/20)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-20)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-auto-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-20)%5B%5B13%5D%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-auto-13))

In agreement with Dennett's prediction, over the past decades the Darwinian perspective has spread ever more widely, in particular across the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences "Social sciences") as the foundation for numerous schools of study including [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics "Memetics"), [evolutionary economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_economics "Evolutionary economics"), [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology "Evolutionary psychology"), [evolutionary anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_anthropology "Evolutionary anthropology"), [neural Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Darwinism "Neural Darwinism"), and [evolutionary linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_linguistics "Evolutionary linguistics").[21](app://obsidian.md/21)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-21)) Researchers have postulated Darwinian processes as operating at the foundations of physics, cosmology and chemistry via the theories of [quantum Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Darwinism "Quantum Darwinism"),[22](app://obsidian.md/22)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-22)) [observation selection effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle "Anthropic principle") and [cosmological natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_natural_selection "Cosmological natural selection").[23](app://obsidian.md/23)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-23)%5B%5B24%5D%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-24)) Similar mechanisms are extensively applied in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") in the domains of [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithms "Genetic algorithms") and [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation "Evolutionary computation"), which develop solutions to complex problems via a process of variation and selection.

Author D. B. Kelley has formulated one of the most all-encompassing approaches to universal Darwinism. In his 2013 book _The Origin of Phenomena_, he holds that [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection") involves not the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, as shown by [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin"), but the preservation of favored systems in contention for existence. The fundamental mechanism behind all such stability and evolution is therefore what Kelley calls "[survival of the fittest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest "Survival of the fittest") systems."[25](app://obsidian.md/25)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-:0-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-:0-25)) Because all systems are cyclical, the Darwinian processes of [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration"), variation and [selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection") are operative not only among species but among all natural phenomena both large-scale and small. Kelley thus maintains that, since the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") especially, the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") has evolved from a highly chaotic state to one that is now highly ordered with many stable phenomena, naturally selected.[25](app://obsidian.md/25)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-:0-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#cite_note-:0-25))

## Examples of universal Darwinist theories

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Darwinism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Examples of universal Darwinist theories")]

The following approaches can all be seen as exemplifying a generalization of Darwinian ideas outside of their original domain of biology. These "Darwinian extensions" can be grouped in two categories, depending on whether they discuss implications of biological (genetic) evolution in other disciplines (e.g. medicine or psychology), or discuss processes of variation and selection of entities other than genes (e.g. computer programs, firms or ideas). However, there is no strict separation possible, since most of these approaches (e.g. in sociology, psychology and linguistics) consider both genetic and non-genetic (e.g. cultural) aspects of evolution, as well as the interactions between them (see e.g. [gene-culture coevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-culture_coevolution "Gene-culture coevolution")).
